# ITT440-FTP
Individual project - Basic FTP in Python
by MUHAMMAD HAKIMI BIN MOHD LAJI (2019290708)

WHY?
1. I need to pass this subject.
2. FTP on Linux is great but can be difficult to use sometimes. My code aimed to simplify everything.

For this to work, you will need an FTP domain. Follow instructions here:

HOW?
1. Edit the directory into *your* directory at line 13 in *ftp.py*
2. Run the code

TROUBLESHOOT
1. Make sure the firewall on both server and client allowed the FTP connection
2. Log into a valid user account on the server side
3. Use python3

For now, *ftp.py* functions are severely lacking. What works are:
- retrieve single file
- send single file    - BREAKS
- list files

What I want to add:
- retrieve multiple files
- send multiple files
- change directory    - DONE
- remove file(s)      - DONE
- rename file         - DONE
- create/remove folder
- security stuffs
- etc...

I will try my best (；⌣̀_⌣́)
